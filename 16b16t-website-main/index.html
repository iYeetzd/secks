								I've made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm simply here to apologize. So what we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned, and the reactions you saw on tape were raw, they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react, or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't, and for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the Internet. I want to apologize to anyone who's seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide, but most importantly, I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. They do not deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all inclusive in the world I live in. I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said, I've made a huge mistake. I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed in myself and I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.

							If you somehow find a better alternative, do not hesitate to tell me. Although I think I've managed to find the cheapest way of hosting this, and still have great hardware and network.

                            The minecraft server computer costs €45 a month. The hardware is an AMD RYZEN 5 3600, 64 gb ram (16gb allocated to 16b16t) and 2x512gb nvme SSD. Additionally, we have great network. The bandwidth is 1 gigabit up and down. The server is hosted in Central Europe (Germany).
